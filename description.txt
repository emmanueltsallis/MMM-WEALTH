ORIGIN:

The origin of the MMM model can be traced back to Mario Possas's Ph.D. Thesis (Possas 1983). In order to explain the main components of the dynamics of a capitalist economy, Possas combines theoretical propositions of three of the most influential economists of the twentieth century: John Maynard Keynes, Michail Kalecki and Joseph Schumpeter. 
Possas stablishes a multisectoral model where basic units are the sectors and intersectoral relationships give birth to dynamics, not only sectoral but also aggregated. The model was based on input-output matrices to determine sectoral conponents of the intermediate consumption of each sector. 
As highligthed by the author, the model was already very complex and it would require a solution by computer simulation. However, due to the inexistent computation and processing power at that time, he opted for analytical solution. Only at the end of 90's the author started to work again in the model, now with enough computational power to use numeric solution. 
Possas and Dweck (2004) presented the consolidated MMM model for the first time while Dweck (2006) did an extensive analysis of the dynamic properties. This version builds upon that foundation, adding complex fiscal policy dimensions and agent behavior related to wealth and taxation.

MODEL DESCRIPTION AND FEATURES:

The MMM model is a multisectoral micro-macro dynamic simulation model combining theoretical foundations from Post-Keynesian, Kaleckian, and Schumpeterian approaches, useful for investigating general dynamic properties of capitalist economies.
Extending this framework, the MMM-WEALTH model explicitly incorporates wealth distribution dynamics, wealth taxation policies, and behavioral responses such as tax evasion through capital flight.

Key features remain:
*  Multisectoral: Intersectoral linkages (input-output) drive dynamics. Production sectors (Capital, Intermediate, Consumption Goods) and Income Classes interact.
*  Dynamic: Discrete time, disequilibrium model based on agent decisions (production, pricing, investment, innovation).
*  Micro-Macro: Firm-level decisions aggregate to sectoral/macro outcomes, with feedback loops.
*  Theoretical: Focuses on general dynamic properties of stylized capitalist economies.

New Core Features (Wealth Taxation & Evasion Module):

*  Wealth Heterogeneity: Allows for negative net wealth (debt) at the class level. Assumes intra-class wealth follows a Pareto distribution, enabling estimation of the proportion of households liable for wealth tax based on a threshold.
*  Wealth Taxation: Implements a configurable tax on household net wealth above a specified threshold. Potential tax revenue is calculated based on the estimated taxpayer base and their average wealth above the threshold (using Pareto conditional expectation).
*  Tax Evasion Decision: Income classes endogenously decide the proportion of domestic wealth to evade via capital flight based on a comparison of expected payoffs:
    *  Compliance Payoff: Considers domestic interest rates and the effective wealth tax burden.
    *  Evasion Payoff: Considers foreign interest rates, *expected* exchange rate changes, and the *expected* probability of detection and penalties.
*  Capital Repatriation Decision: Classes with existing external wealth decide the proportion to repatriate based on expected payoffs:
    *  Repatriation Payoff: Considers domestic interest rates and potential tax on repatriated wealth.
    *  Keep Abroad Payoff: Considers foreign interest rates and *realized* exchange rate changes on the domestic currency value of external assets.
*  Capital Flight & Repatriation Dynamics: Modeled as flows altering domestic (`Class_Stock_Deposits`) and external (`Class_External_Stock_Deposits`, tracked in domestic currency) wealth stocks, ensuring stock-flow consistency using lagged flows.
*  Dynamic Government Enforcement: The government's audit rate (probability of detecting capital flight) adjusts dynamically based on observed changes in the aggregate evasion rate.
*  Adaptive Expectations: Classes form expectations about the government's audit rate adaptively, based on past observed rates and their expectation formation parameters.
*  Wealth Penalties: If capital flight is detected (probabilistically), a penalty is levied on the evaded amount, contributing to government revenue but reducing the amount successfully transferred abroad.
*  Capital Controls: A switch allows simulating scenarios where capital controls prevent tax evasion via capital flight.
*  Exchange Rate Effects: Exchange rate dynamics explicitly influence the domestic currency value of external assets and the payoffs for evasion/repatriation decisions.

Theoretical: the main goal of the model is to investigate general dynamic properties of capitalist economies, so the results are general, theoretical, representing only the essential elements of a non-specic capitalist economy. Historical, national and intitutional particularities are, most of the time, omited from the model.

Agent-Based: Firms are the main agents. Each firm belongs only to one sector. Structural changes in each sector are endogenously dependent on firms behavior, especially as a result of technological and strategic diversity.  Firms decide on:
	(i) production, prices and profits: production decisions are based on expected sales for the production period, extrapolated from the average of some previous periods. As to prices, themodel assumes each sector to be an oligopoly with some degree of price competition as well as of product differentiation, following a version of Kalecki's price model (1954, ch. 1), in which actual price is a weighted average of the price corresponding to the expected markup and the industry average price, but subject to change according to a feedback from the firm's competitive performance.
	(ii) investment: investment decision rules on new capacity are also based on extrapolated expected sales from some previous (investment) periods but limited by a debt constraint following Kalecki's principle of increasing risk (1954, ch. 8). Wider financial features are included in these decisions to capture the influence of assets and liabilities structure of the firm, represented by debt/equity ratio, retained profits and liquidity demand.
	(iii) technological search:  technological search combines different approaches: both innovative and imitative searches follow a stochastic process as in Nelson and Winter (1982) and a learning process is also included drawing on the vintage model by Silverberg et al. (1988), from which a payback period criterion for equipment replacement decisions is also applied.

Income Classes as Agents (Wealth Module): Classes now make active decisions regarding their wealth portfolio based on the introduction of a wealth tax. Key aspects include:
*  Wealth Heterogeneity: Allows for negative net wealth (debt). Assumes intra-class wealth follows a Pareto distribution (`class_pareto_alpha`) to estimate the proportion of households (`Class_Taxpayer_Proportion`) liable for wealth tax above a threshold (`wealth_tax_threshold`).
*  Evasion/Repatriation Decision: Based on comparing expected payoffs (using lagged wealth, interest rates, expected audit rates, penalties, and exchange rate dynamics) for compliance vs. evasion, and for keeping wealth abroad vs. repatriating it. This determines `Class_Evasion_Rate` and `Class_Repatriation_Rate`.
*  Capital Flight/Repatriation: Modeled as flows altering domestic (`Class_Stock_Deposits`) and external (`Class_External_Stock_Deposits`, tracked in domestic currency) wealth stocks.
*  Adaptive Expectations: Classes form expectations of the government audit rate (`Class_Expected_Audit_Rate`) based on past observations and an expectation weight (`class_expectation_weight`).

TIMELINE OF EVENTS:

1. Planned Production: (first firm's decision) Differentiated among sectors: for consumption and intermediate goods it depends on expected sales; for capital goods it depends of effective orders. 
2. Effective Production: it depends on the productive capacity and inputs availability, given de planned production. Firms in every sector use labor, capital and inputs in order to produce, based on a Leontief production function.
3. Price Decision: (second firm's decision) Weighted average among desired price and average market price; desired price is determined by a desired mark up over variable cost.
4. External Sector: Exports are determined by a fixed coefficient, over the rest of the world income and the corresponding income elasticity on the world market.
5. Total sectoral orders:
	i. Consumption Goods: depends on income classes and exports.
	ii. Capital Goods: depends on firms' decisions to invest and exports.
	iii. Intermediate Goods: third firm's decision: depends on firm's decision to order intermediate goods for next period production.
6. Firm's orders: effective orders received by a firm depend on total sectorial demand, and on the firm's market share, determined by the replicator dynamic equation, under the effect of firm's competitiveness.
7. Sales: actual sales are determined by the effective orders, which may or may not correspond to the expectations that previously defined the level of production. This interaction between sales and production over time creates a mechanism of dynamic induction over the subsequent production decisions, via changes on the expected behavior of future sales. Orders not met by firm's production and sales becomes delivery delay and negatively affect firm's competitiveness.
8. Income creation
	i. Functional distribution
		Total Wages: determined by government wages and private wages. Private wages depend on sector's effective production times unitary wage of each firm and R&D expenses.
		Total Profits: determined by revenue, discounting indirect tax and R&D expenses, and unit variable cost; part is distributed to households and the rest is reinvested or allocated at the financial sector.
		Interest Income: Calculated based on the lagged stock of deposits.
	ii. Personal distribution: total wages and total distributed profits are converted into personal income by a matrix of income appropriation for each class (wage share and profit share of each class).If wealth tax is active (`begin_wealth_tax`), the potential tax (`Class_Potential_Wealth_Tax`) is calculated based on the estimated taxpayer proportion and Pareto conditional expectation.
9.Evasion & Repatriation Decision:
    *   Classes calculate expected payoffs for Compliance, Evasion, Keeping Abroad, Repatriation based on lagged wealth, interest/exchange rates, and expected audit rate.
    *   Evasion Rate (`Class_Evasion_Rate`) and Repatriation Rate (`Class_Repatriation_Rate`) determined (subject to `switch_capital_controls`).
10.Capital Flows, Penalties & Effective Tax:
    *   Capital Flight (`Class_Capital_Flight`) and Repatriation (`Class_Capital_Repatriation`) calculated.
    *   Wealth Penalties (`Class_Wealth_Penalties`) calculated probabilistically based on flight amount and government audit rate.
    *   Effective Wealth Tax (`Class_Effective_Wealth_Tax`) calculated = Potential Tax * (1 - Evasion Rate).
    *   Other direct taxes calculated based on `switch_class_tax_structure`.
    *   Government total tax revenue (`Government_Total_Taxes`) updated, including effective wealth tax and penalties.
11.Consumption and Savings Decisions: (Implicitly affected by tax calculation and wealth changes)
12.Wealth Stock Updates:
    *   Domestic (`Class_Stock_Deposits`): Updated considering savings/dissaving (now allows `Class_Available_Deposits` to be negative, reducing stock), interest returns (on lagged stock), net capital flows (lagged: Repatriation Inflow - Flight Outflow), anddirect deduction of `Class_Effective_Wealth_Tax` (if `switch_class_tax_structure` = 5).
    *   External (`Class_External_Stock_Deposits`): Updated considering interest, exchange rate valuation effects, net capital flows (lagged: Flight In net of Penalties - Repatriation Out).
13. Investment Decision: (fourth firm's decision) given the financial restriction, at the end of each investment period firms must decide the amount of investment. This decision is divided into three different components:
	i. Investment on capacity expansion (induced liquid investment): depends on expected sales and the capacity utilization level;
	ii. Investment on physical depreciation: added to the first one, they both comprise the induced gross investment;
	iii. Investment given the technological obsolescence of capital equipment (autonomous investment): depends on the innovative success and the payback calculus;
14. R&D: the innovation and diffusion (imitation) processes follow closely those 2 stage processes proposed by Nelson & Winter (1982, ch. 12). Technological search by any firm is accomplished through process and product R&D. 
15. Entry and Exit: firms can exit because of small market share of high debt rate. The total number of firms is not constant, but entry only occurs in case of exit. The possibility of entry of a new firm is limited to an exit caused by financial problems.
16.Government Policy Update: `Government_Audit_Rate` potentially adjusted based on change in `Country_Evasion_Rate` and `gov_audit_sensitivity`.
17.Expectations Update: `Class_Expected_Audit_Rate` updated based on lagged `Government_Audit_Rate` and `class_expectation_weight`.

MODEL CALIBRATION AND INITIALIZATION

This version includes an automatic initialization and calibration procedures. Users do not need to define all parameters and lagged values manually since most of them are calculated and writen by the model itself at the first time period based only on a subset of parameters and some hypothesis (homogeneity among firms and stock-flow consistency norms).
Most of the parameters that contains the word "initial" on their names are used only for this procedure.
Additionally, multiple instances of objects are created in this proceadure. The initial number of objects are parameters controlled by the user.

Hypothesis:
1-All firms start homogeneously inside each sector. Heterogeneity among firms will be generated during the simulation.
2-The economy starts in a non-growth steady-state position. Growth and cycles will be generated endogenouslly during the simulation.
3-All stock-flows ratios must be constant.
4-There are no expansion or replacement investment, so initial investment is only to replace physically depreciated capital goods.

To better understand that procedure, see variable "init_2".
