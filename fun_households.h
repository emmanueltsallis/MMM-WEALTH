EQUATION("Household_Employment_Status")
/*
Stage 5.2b: MARKOV employment transitions using CAPACITY UTILIZATION signal.
Uses baseline churn + gap amplification for stable secular stagnation dynamics.

Employment State Codes:
- -1 = Capitalist (not in labor force)
-  0 = Unemployed worker
-  1 = Employed (simplified - no sector tracking for wage normalization)

CAPACITY UTILIZATION APPROACH (Post-Keynesian/Kaleckian):
- Signal = Country_Capacity_Utilization - target_utilization
- Baseline churn ensures job turnover even at equilibrium (matching friction)
- Gap amplifies/dampens baseline rates
- Supports stable low-level equilibrium (secular stagnation)

FORMULA:
- P_hire = base_hire × (1 + hiring_speed × max(0, gap)) × skill_boost
- P_fire = base_fire × (1 + firing_speed × max(0, -gap)) / skill_protect

SKILL MODULATION:
- High-skill workers are more likely to be hired (skill attracts, capped at 2×)
- High-skill workers are less likely to be fired (skill protects, floor at 0.5)

Stage 4.4b: Import share with budget-based price elasticity.

Post-Keynesian approach: Poor households are more price-sensitive than rich.
- Innate propensity: household_import_propensity (heterogeneous, set at init)
- Price ratio: domestic_price / (foreign_price * exchange_rate)
- Budget-based elasticity: 2.0 for poor → 0.5 for rich (endogenous)

Budget calculation:
- discretionary_ratio = (avg_income - autonomous_consumption) / avg_income
- Poor households (low discretionary ratio) → elasticity ≈ 2.0
- Rich households (high discretionary ratio) → elasticity ≈ 0.5

This removes the need for calibrated elasticity parameters - behavior emerges
from household's budget position relative to their subsistence needs.
